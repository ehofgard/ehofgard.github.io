I'm currently a PhD student in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) at MIT. I'm a proud member of the [Atomic Architects Research Group](https://atomicarchitects.com/), advised by [Professor Tess Smidt](https://blondegeek.github.io/). I also work closely with the [Griffin Group](https://sineadgriffin.com/) in the Molecular Foundry at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. I received a master's degree in Computational and Mathematical Engineering ('22) and a bachelor's degree in physics with honors ('21), both from Stanford University. I'm funded by the Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellowship.

I worked with the ATLAS collaboration at CERN during undergrad and my master's degree with [Professor Lauren Tompkins](https://stanford.edu/group/stanford_atlas/#). In my PhD, I pivoted to computational materials science and machine learning (ML) development. I'm passionate about applying computational tools to materials design and problems in condensed matter physics. I enjoy working on projects where I am able to collaborate across disciplines, learn about a new scientific field, and interface with experimentalists. Lately, I have been working on modeling phase transitions in exotic magnetic materials, characterizing length scales of order in amorphous materials, and developing representation learning methods for applications in powder X-ray diffraction. See my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=S67jpMkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and my [CV](/assets/pdf/Elyssa_Hofgard_CV.pdf) for more information.

Outside of research, I love to hike, backpack, and spend time outdoors. I also am an avid swimmer and a member of the MIT Women's Chorale.
